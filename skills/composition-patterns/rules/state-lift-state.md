## Lift State into Provider Components

Move state management into dedicated provider components. This allows sibling components outside the main UI to access and modify state without prop drilling or awkward refs.

**Incorrect (state trapped inside component):**

```tsx
function ForwardMessageComposer() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
  const forwardMessage = useForwardMessage()

  return (
    <Composer.Frame>
      <Composer.Input />
      <Composer.Footer />
    </Composer.Frame>
  )
}

// Problem: How does this button access composer state?
function ForwardMessageDialog() {
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <ForwardMessageComposer />
      <MessagePreview /> {/* Needs composer state */}
      <DialogActions>
        <CancelButton />
        <ForwardButton /> {/* Needs to call submit */}
      </DialogActions>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```

**Correct (state lifted to provider):**

```tsx
function ForwardMessageProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
  const forwardMessage = useForwardMessage()
  const inputRef = useRef(null)

  return (
    <Composer.Provider
      state={state}
      actions={{ update: setState, submit: forwardMessage }}
      meta={{ inputRef }}
    >
      {children}
    </Composer.Provider>
  )
}

function ForwardMessageDialog() {
  return (
    <ForwardMessageProvider>
      <Dialog>
        <ForwardMessageComposer />
        <MessagePreview /> {/* Uses Composer.Context */}
        <DialogActions>
          <CancelButton />
          <ForwardButton /> {/* Uses actions.submit from context */}
        </DialogActions>
      </Dialog>
    </ForwardMessageProvider>
  )
}

function ForwardButton() {
  const { actions } = use(Composer.Context)
  return <Button onPress={actions.submit}>Forward</Button>
}
```

The ForwardButton lives outside the Composer.Frame but still has access to the submit action because it's within the provider.

**Key insight:** Components that need shared state don't have to be visually nested inside each other—they just need to be within the same provider.
