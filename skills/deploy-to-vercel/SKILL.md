# Deploy to Vercel

Deploy any project to Vercel. **Always deploy as preview** (not production) unless the user explicitly asks for production.

The goal is to get the user into the best long-term setup: their project linked to Vercel with git-push deploys. Every method below tries to move the user closer to that state.

## Step 1: Gather Project State

Run all four checks before deciding which method to use:

```bash
# 1. Check for a git remote
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null

# 2. Check if locally linked to a Vercel project (either file means linked)
cat .vercel/project.json 2>/dev/null || cat .vercel/repo.json 2>/dev/null

# 3. Check if the Vercel CLI is installed and authenticated
vercel whoami 2>/dev/null

# 4. List available teams (if authenticated)
vercel teams list --format json 2>/dev/null
```

### Team selection

If the user belongs to multiple teams, present all available team slugs as a bulleted list and ask which one to deploy to. Once the user picks a team, proceed immediately to the next step — do not ask for additional confirmation.

Pass the team slug via `--scope` on all subsequent CLI commands (`vercel deploy`, `vercel link`, `vercel inspect`, etc.):

```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>
```

If the project is already linked (`.vercel/project.json` or `.vercel/repo.json` exists), the `orgId` in those files determines the team — no need to ask again. If there is only one team (or just a personal account), skip the prompt and use it directly.

**About the `.vercel/` directory:** A linked project has either:
- `.vercel/project.json` — created by `vercel link` (single project linking). Contains `projectId` and `orgId`.
- `.vercel/repo.json` — created by `vercel link --repo` (repo-based linking). Contains `orgId`, `remoteName`, and a `projects` array mapping directories to Vercel project IDs.

Either file means the project is linked. Check for both.

**Do NOT** use `vercel project inspect`, `vercel ls`, or `vercel link` to detect state in an unlinked directory — without a `.vercel/` config, they will interactively prompt (or with `--yes`, silently link as a side-effect). Only `vercel whoami` is safe to run anywhere.

## Step 2: Choose a Deploy Method

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + has git remote → Git Push

This is the ideal state. The project is linked and has git integration.

1. **Ask the user before pushing.** Never push without explicit approval:
   ```
   This project is connected to Vercel via git. I can commit and push to
   trigger a deployment. Want me to proceed?
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "deploy: <description of changes>"
   git push
   ```
   Vercel automatically builds from the push. Non-production branches get preview deployments; the production branch (usually `main`) gets a production deployment.

3. **Retrieve the preview URL.** If the CLI is authenticated, find the deployment of the commit you pushed:
   ```bash
   vercel ls <project-name> --meta githubCommitSha=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --format json
   ```
   The preview URL is `.deployments[0].url`. For GitLab or Bitbucket remotes, filter on `gitlabCommitSha` or `bitbucketCommitSha` instead. The deployment can take a few seconds to appear after the push; if `deployments` is empty, run the command again. Pass the project name so a monorepo returns this project's deployment, not a sibling project's built from the same commit.

   To wait for the build to finish, run `vercel inspect <url> --wait --timeout 20m` (see below).

   If the CLI is not authenticated, tell the user to check the Vercel dashboard or the commit status checks on their git provider for the preview URL.

---

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + no git remote → `vercel deploy`

The project is linked but there's no git repo. Deploy directly with the CLI.

```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait
```

Use `--no-wait` so the CLI returns immediately with the deployment URL instead of blocking until the build finishes (builds can take a while). Then check on the deployment status with:

```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

To wait for the build to finish, make one blocking call instead of polling with `sleep` and repeated `vercel inspect`:

```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url> --wait --timeout 20m
```

It returns when the build finishes and exits non-zero if the deployment fails, is canceled, or the timeout is reached first. The default timeout is 3m, too short for most real builds, so pass a longer one. If it fails, read the build logs with `vercel inspect <deployment-url> --logs`.

For production deploys (only if user explicitly asks):
```bash
vercel deploy [path] --prod -y --no-wait
```

---

### Not linked + CLI is authenticated → Link first, then deploy

The CLI is working but the project isn't linked yet. This is the opportunity to get the user into the best state.

1. **Ask the user which team to deploy to.** Present the team slugs from Step 1 as a bulleted list. If there's only one team (or just a personal account), skip this step.

2. **Once a team is selected, proceed directly to linking.** Tell the user what will happen but do not ask for separate confirmation:
   ```
   Linking this project to <team name> on Vercel. This will create a Vercel
   project to deploy to and enable automatic deployments on future git pushes.
   ```

3. **If a git remote exists**, use repo-based linking with the selected team scope:
   ```bash
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug>
   ```
   This reads the git remote URL and matches it to existing Vercel projects that deploy from that repo. It creates `.vercel/repo.json`. This is much more reliable than `vercel link` (without `--repo`), which tries to match by directory name and often fails when the local folder and Vercel project are named differently.

   **If there is no git remote**, fall back to standard linking:
   ```bash
   vercel link --scope <team-slug>
   ```
   This prompts the user to select or create a project. It creates `.vercel/project.json`.

4. **Then deploy using the best available method:**
   - If a git remote exists → commit and push (see git push method above)
   - If no git remote → `vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>`, then `vercel inspect <url>` to check status (`--wait --timeout 20m` to wait for the build)

---

### Not linked + CLI not authenticated → Install, auth, link, deploy

The Vercel CLI isn't set up at all.

1. **Install the CLI (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   The user completes auth in their browser. If running in a non-interactive environment where login is not possible, skip to the **no-auth fallback** below.

3. **Ask which team to deploy to** — present team slugs from `vercel teams list --format json` as a bulleted list. If only one team / personal account, skip. Once selected, proceed immediately.

4. **Link the project** with the selected team scope (use `--repo` if a git remote exists, plain `vercel link` otherwise):
   ```bash
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug>   # if git remote exists
   vercel link --scope <team-slug>          # if no git remote
   ```

5. **Deploy** using the best available method (git push if remote exists, otherwise `vercel deploy -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>`, then `vercel inspect <url>` to check status, with `--wait --timeout 20m` to wait for the build).

---

### No-Auth Fallback — `vercel deploy --temporary`

**When to use:** The CLI has no credentials and `vercel login` isn't possible (sandboxes, agents, non-interactive environments). Do **not** ask the user to approve a CLI login or device code first — try this.

```bash
npx vercel@latest deploy [path] --temporary -y
```

No account is needed. The CLI builds locally, deploys to a temporary production URL, and prints a **claim URL** plus how long until the deployment expires. Rerunning the command in the same directory redeploys the same temporary project until it expires.

Temporary deployments don't work in CI or in a directory already linked to a Vercel project. See https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-without-logging-in.

**Tell the user:** "Your deployment is ready at [url]. It expires in [time] unless you claim it at [claimUrl]. Don't share the claim link."

**Escalated network access (Codex):** Only escalate the deploy command if sandboxing blocks the network call (`sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`).

---

## Agent-Specific Notes

### Claude Code / terminal-based agents

You have full shell access. Follow the decision flow above using the CLI directly.

### Sandboxed environments (claude.ai, Codex)

Check whether the CLI is logged in with `vercel whoami`. If it is, follow Step 2, including team selection. If it isn't, use the **no-auth fallback**.

---

## Output

Always show the user the deployment URL.

- **Git push:** Use `vercel ls <project-name> --meta githubCommitSha=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --format json` to find the preview URL. If the CLI isn't authenticated, tell the user to check the Vercel dashboard or commit status checks.
- **CLI deploy:** Show the URL returned by `vercel deploy --no-wait`. Use `vercel inspect <url>` to check build status, or `vercel inspect <url> --wait --timeout 20m` to wait for it, and report it to the user.
- **No-auth fallback:** Show the deployment URL, the claim URL, and the expiry the CLI printed.

**Do not** curl or fetch the deployed URL to verify it works. Just return the link.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Network Egress Error (claude.ai)

If deployment fails due to network restrictions on claude.ai, tell the user:

```
Deployment failed due to network restrictions. To fix this:

1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities
2. Add *.vercel.com and registry.npmjs.org to the allowed domains
3. Try deploying again
```

### Escalated Network Access (Codex / sandboxed environments)

If deployment fails due to network issues (timeouts, DNS errors, connection resets) in a sandboxed environment, rerun with escalated permissions (`sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). Do not escalate the initial CLI availability check — only escalate the actual deploy command.

Example guidance to the user:
```
The deploy needs escalated network access to deploy to Vercel. I can rerun
the command with escalated permissions — want me to proceed?
```

### CLI Auth Failure

If `vercel login` or `vercel deploy` fails with authentication errors, use the no-auth fallback: `vercel deploy --temporary -y`.
